                      <span class="say"> Liu Tingting, I hope you are in a good mood when you open the letter.</span><br>
                      <span class="say"> I have always been a person with no sense of ceremony until I met someone the day before yesterday and argued with her. </span><br>
                      <span class="say">Although I was very unhappy, I benefited a lot. Meeting you is my luck and my misfortune. I don't know where we will go or how we will develop.</span><br>             
                      <span class="say">  But I hope to be happy together as I wish. I don't know whether the lipstick that I, a person who has neither a sense of ceremony nor experience, chose is to your liking.</span><br>
                      <span class="say"> I originally chose another color number, but because I wanted the express delivery to be delivered on the 14th, that color number was out of stock, so I chose a new one, but the difference between the two is not very big.</span><br>
                      <span class="say">I think this faint color suits you very well. Maybe it's my own favorite color. I hope you can like it. This lipstick is expensive or not, and it is not cheap. I hope you can take it.</span><br>
                      <span class="say"> If you don't like this color number, it's ok to save it, but I hope you can use it one day.I gave you this lipstick for two purposes, one is to make up for your father's love that you lacked before, and the other is that I want to change my virtue of not having a sense of ceremony, not to ask for your relationship or to get your favor.</span><br>
                      <span class="say"> I know that a girl like you is very sensitive, both eager for love and afraid of being loved, and insecure.</span><br>
                      <span class="say">I know that you are not incapable of loving, and you are afraid, you are avoiding, you are afraid of meeting bad men, and you are afraid of repeating the same mistakes.</span><br>
                      <span class="say"> I hope you can believe me once. I'm not like your father. I'm single-minded (a little narcissistic).I will do my best to love you, love you and hug you. I believe that if we go to the end, my parents will treat you like their own daughters.</span><br>
                      <span class="say">I always fall in love with the purpose of getting married, but when I meet you, I think we can try to fall in love first, not because you are so good, but because you deserve it.  At the same time, maybe this way you can really understand me and trust me. Even if we can't get together in the end, we still have a good memory, right?In fact, not only you are afraid, but I am also afraid. I am afraid that you will reject me and suddenly accept me, because I am not ready yet. I still don't know how to love someone and how to express my love. Moreover, I am not good-looking and can't wear it. I have no sense of ceremony. There are really many shortcomings, and I have to correct them slowly. I don't think I deserve you, but I think we are really suitable for each other, and I like you very much, so I summon up courage to go to you, hoping that you can get out of the shadows and don't run away.I will give you the love and security you lack, and you will give me the security I lack.At this point, there is nothing to say. I just hope that whether you continue to avoid it or face it calmly, you can live happily and find someone you think is worth it.
Finally, lipstick can be delivered on time in the future, and I hope you like it and feel happy after reading the letter. Because of my poor English, I used a lot of mechanical translation. I hope you can understand what I mean.As for who I am, don't you know?</span><br>
